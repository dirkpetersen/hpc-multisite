# Why Redis 

Redis is the fastest scalable open source storage solution available and has matured since 2011. It supports 17 programming languages and has been a common approach for high performance low latency storage solutions. Redis supports asynchronous replication which is a key feature required for high performance multi-site data sharing.  Recently, several new Redis-compatible implementations such as keydb, kvrocks, dragonflydb and memurai have been developed in addition to implementations in AWS (MemoryDB and ElastiCache), Azure and Google. This confirms that the Redis ecosystem and protocol have become a de-facto standard for highest performance storage solutions. Redis can not only function as a database but also as a caching solution which can support the increasing demand for multi-site and multi-cloud operations.
